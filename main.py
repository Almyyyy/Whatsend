Project Name:           Whatsend
Author:                 Almyyyy
Start Date:             02/26/2021
Description: This program can be used to send a message to a list of phone numbers using WhatsApp Web.



Used Modules:
urllib      used to encode a text of any type in url-encoding (percent-encoding)
time        just for code timing :) ...and Facebook/WhatsApp anti-bot policies
selenium    to embed browser event in Python
            note:       to use this library you need to download the latest chosen browser's webdriver
                        (you can find it here: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers)
                        and set it as a environment variable (PATH)
                        
                        
                  
How it works:
Basically take a look at this WhatsApp Web Url: https://web.whatsapp.com/send?phone=+391238956456&text=this.+is.+a.+complex.+message%21
Did you notice something? Ok, let me break it down ->       https://web.whatsapp.com/   ->   the basic WhatsApp Web Url              
                                                   ->       send?phone=+391238956456   ->   the recipient phone number argument      
                                                   ->       &text=this.+is.+a.+complex.+message%21   ->   the message encoded in pecent-encoding
If you put that Url in your favourite browser (maybe changing the phone number into an existing one)
it will pop up a classic WhatsApp chat window with the message already written. (note: you must be logged in)                                       
Clear, right? So... Why not generate that Url programmatically?
Now there is one last thing to do, clicks! And here Selenium module comes in.
Briefly. Selenium is able to search for objects in the HTML DOM and emulate events... like clicks! (and other stuff that we will need further on.
With that being said let's jump into the code! :)



Changelog:

- v0.1 project draft with main functions
- v0.1.1 minor bug fix (like internet signal loss or inexitent phone number crashes)
- v0.2 code in now translated from Italian to English because is cool and more people can benefit B) 



{code may still buggy}
